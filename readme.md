# Hello!

I chose to wrote this in Node.

gameOfLife.js is an npm module for creating a GoL simulation.

gameOfLifeStdinterface.js is the file you want to run.

```node gameOfLifeStdinterface.js```,
followed by your standard input data.

I was working on allowing a flag --watch `interval-time` that would animate the game in the console, but I couldn't get backspaces to erase new lines. Not sure if that's possible -- gonna keep looking at it. As of now, it just prints out each new iteration in succession.

Let me know if you have any questions!
